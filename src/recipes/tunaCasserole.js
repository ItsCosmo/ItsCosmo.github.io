    "American cheese works best, although I have used cheddar. Sometimes, I add black olives and/or cashews.",
    "I now use tuna packed in water, low fat cream of mushroom soup, and not so much cheese, since it's loaded with fat. (HK)",
    "Note from editor: I like cheddar cheese, black olives and full-on cream of mushroom soup. (PK)"
